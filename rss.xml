So, looks like ol’ Donald Gillingham, who's a real beaut from Holyrood, was caught snoozing behind the wheel of his car. Some good-hearted soul thought he was in trouble and called the Mounties. But turns out, before the coppers even got there, ol’ Don managed to tap another car with his. 

Now here's the kicker – when they did catch up with him, he wouldn't take a breath test. Smart move, eh? Apparently, he's got a knack for this sorta thing, with two other refusals and an impaired driving charge already on his record. The man's like a broken record, playing the same tune over and over. Anyways, he's off to court again on August 12th. Maybe this time he’ll get the message, but I’m not holding my breath!]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh me nerves, b'y, ye won't believe the yarn I’ve got for ya from Bridgus Junction.

Public Safety Minister John Haggie’s givin’ a tip of the hat to the crews for battlin’ the beast under what he calls “extraordinary conditions.” I mean, 40 millimetres of rain didn’t make a lick of difference to the fire, if ya can imagine!

But hold onto your hats for a sec—there’s still some hot spots being worked on, so don’t be surprised if you catch a whiff of smoke every now and then. Meanwhile, the poor cabin owners over in Chance Harbour can finally get a peek at their places, just be sure to check that map ‘cause some spots are still no-go zones. Honestly, this whole thing feels like we’re in a movie or somethin’, but at least folks are safely back home where they can have a mug up and relax—well, as much as you can with a forest fire in your backyard!]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, let me tell ya somethin’ b’ys, folks in Musgrave Harbour finally made it back home after nearly a week of campin’ out somewhere else ‘cause of that wildfire that was knockin’ on everyone’s doorstep.

So they're givin' it a go tomorrow instead. Supposed to be a beauty of a day they'll have then – sunshine and warmth with a nice light breeze. Only in Newfoundland would we have to wait for the weather to make up its mind, eh? Hopefully, it shows up like the forecast says this time!]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ah, b'y, looks like the Harbour Grace Regatta's gone and got itself pushed to tomorrow. They were thinkin' about havin' it today, but with all that rain comin' down they figured it'd be a right soggy mess. Can't be havin' the boats floatin' on rain instead of water, now can we? So they're givin' it a go tomorrow instead. Supposed to be a beauty of a day they'll have then – sunshine and warmth with a nice light breeze.

A fellah, 47 years old, got himself hauled up by the cops for sexual assault over in the west end last night. The RNC got the call just before 8 o'clock. Ain’t that a lovely way to spend your evening?

Not only is he facing sexual assault charges, but they’ve also slapped on assault, uttering threats, and breach of probation for good measure. Sounds like he was busy, eh? They kept him in custody overnight, probably to cool his head before seeing the judge.

Suppose jury duty’s gonna be real popular this season—nothing like a bit of local scandal to keep everyone on their toes. Bet the gossip was flying faster than seagulls in a windstorm this morning. Lord, keep us safe from the jaw-droppers, I say.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, b'ys, it looks like we’ve got more trouble on the go in St. John’s.

Some kind of liquid dope called remifentanil, that's more potent than a winter's gale, might be floating around now. You only need a sniff of the stuff and you're liable to keel over and meet your maker. If anyone's seen hide nor hair of it, they're asking folks to give the RNC a ring or talk to the Crime Stoppers. I tell ya, it's like they sent the Tibb's Eve crew to do Christmas Day's work!]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh me nerves, b'ys!

They just opened up the fancy new digs for the morgue. Yep, they’ve gone from fit only 12 bodies to a whopping 96 now! I'd say that’s a bit of an upgrade, wouldn't ya think? 

Turns out, the old holding place was built way back in 1972 and was gettin’ so crowded they had to haul in them portable freezer units last year. Had everyone up in arms, it did! Some folks were fit to be tied over that one.

But don’t worry, they’ve spruced it up now with a purpose-built space. Even got it all separated out between the NL Health Services and the Chief Medical Examiner's Office. Apparently, it's all part of some lab modernization project. It’s nice to know our province is thinking about the future... I just hope they don't end up needing all 96 spots anytime soon, else we got bigger problems!]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh b'y, did ya hear 'bout the big to-do over at the Health Sciences Centre?
